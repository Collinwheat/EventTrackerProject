# EventTrackerProject

## Description
This project is the beginnings of an event tracker. It connects to a database in which I have populated several Photo objects. In conjunction with this code, the user can utilize Postman to:

<ul>
	<li>List all of the Photos within the database</li>
	<li>Search for one of the Photos using the Photo's assigned ID</li>
	<li>Create a new Photo in the database</li>
	<li>Update a Photo in the database to change it's current information</li>
	<li>Delete a Photo from the database</li>
</ul>

## Lessons Learned
This project was the first application in which I utilized Repositories. The use of them definitely helped me understand their nature and potential. I also learned the importance of being thorough, especially when dealing with many different parts of an application.
