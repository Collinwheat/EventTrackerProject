# PhotoEvents

## Description
This project was created as a way for a Photographer to display and organize photos they've taken along with information about that particular photograph. When the user goes onto the site, they are presented with a table of the photos the photographer has uploaded. The user can click on a photo within the table to see the details about it displayed below, as well as to view the photo itsself. Then, the user has the option to delete, or update the photo. If the user selects delete, the photo will disappear from the database, and the website. If the user selects update, a form will appear asking the user to enter the information about the photo. Upon submitting that new information, the table will regenerate, and the user can select and view the photo in its entirety.

## Lessons Learned
This project definitely helped in my understanding of Angular's project layout and functions. Upon starting, navigating through a project to find what it is I was looking for was tedious, but now doing that is much simpler and easy to understand. Also, This was the first time I've used HTML to display images that i've uploaded to the web, so that took a little bit of trial and error, but now I feel very confident that I could do it again without too much fuss.

## Aspects I'm Proud Of
I'm very proud of the project as a whole. The way that the image displays below the table dynamically is a feature that took me a long time to figure out. Also, upon starting this project, I realized that I had made mistakes while creating the backend that would cause issues if I continued without correcting in some way. I decided that instead of changing everything in the backend, to just continue and adjust my methods of accomplishing a task to work with the backend as well as possible. This problem solving is a skill that im proud to have gotten better at over the course of this project. 

## Things I wanted to do, but ran out of time
I spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out how to get all of the images in a carousel for a nicer looking home page, but unfortunately ran out of time. Also, I would have liked to have added a feature in which the user can click on the image and then be shown the full size photograph along with its meta information displayed alongside it.
